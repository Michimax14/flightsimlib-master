# flightsimlib
Flight Simulator C++ Common libs

## Features
This library currently provides a thin (mostly) cross-platform abstraction for BGL File Decompression. 

More features are coming, starting with BGL-file functions and structures.



## Roadmap
* More Sample code / integration
* Get rid of static .lib dependencies
* Doxygen docs
* Factory methods with C API wrapper to ease integration with other languages
* Open-source more functionality of my Flight Sim projects into this library:
	* BGL File Parsing
	* MDL Files and supporting objects
	* Simprop
	* Autogen
	* Texture Compositing
	* 2D and 3D Graphics
	* Terrain Tiles
	* etc
